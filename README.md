Base Meta Tags
==============

The Base Meta Tags module allows you define base set of meta tags 
for search engines:

 - keywords, descriptions and robots tags - you can set values 
   on per page (node) basis or as default values for all pages 
   where meta tags not defined;
 - for each node you can set value for custom tag title, instead used 
   for this purpose node title;
 - for each node you can re-define canonical URL;
 - you can set different base URL for using in all canonical URLs 
   instead default (actual) site domain.
